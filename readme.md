# Aunderwince TicTacToe


This is a simple game of tic tac toe that I created to test my  javascript/jquery skills.
Most of the games I have seen online require two players, and I wanted to try creating a game where one player plays against the computer.

#### I'm calling on contributors to improve the game in a few ways:

* Make the computer (playing as O) smarter. At the moment the computer randomly chooses a square to play, not trying to get a win.
* Add a win counter
* Allow the human to choose whether to play as X or O
Have the computer make funny remarks with each play / win
