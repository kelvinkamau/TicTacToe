This is a simple game of tic tac toe that I created to refresh my javascript/jquery skills.
Most of the games I have seen online require two players and I wanted to try creating a game where one player plays against the "computer".

#### I'm calling on contributors to improve the game in a few ways:

* Allow the human to choose whether to play as X or O
* Add an optional signup/login with FirebaseAuth & a leaderboard where various players can get ranked.
* <s>Add SSL to secure with HTTPS</s>
* <s>Make the computer (playing as O) intelligent. At the moment the computer randomly chooses a square to play, not trying to get a win.</s>
* Add a score counter & win animation
* Have the computer make funny remarks with each play / win 🌲 🍹
