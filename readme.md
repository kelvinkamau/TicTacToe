#### Ways I plan to improve the game:
* Add an optional signup/login with FirebaseAuth & a leaderboard where various players can get ranked.
* <s>Add SSL to secure with HTTPS</s>
* Allow players to personalize the game's appearance by selecting different themes, colors, and styles for the game board and pieces.
* Introduce multiplayer functionality, enabling players to compete against friends or other online opponents in real-time matches.
* Enhance the AI's decision-making process by using optimized algorithms such as the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient and strategic gameplay.
